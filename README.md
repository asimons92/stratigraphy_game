# Stratigraphy Game

An interactive educational puzzle game that challenges players to correctly order geological layers in stratigraphic sequences. Test your knowledge of geological principles and learn about rock formations, unconformities, and the law of superposition.

## 🎮 Features

- **Three Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard puzzles with varying complexity
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Intuitively reorder geological layers to match the correct sequence
- **Progress Tracking**: 
  - Track wins for each difficulty level
  - View total puzzles solved
  - Monitor completion rate
  - Progress saved locally in your browser
- **Educational Content**: Includes geology content:
  - Stratigraphic Dating
  - Igneous rocks
  - Sedimentary rocks (Shale, Limestone, Sandstone)
  - Geological features (Faults, Unconformities, Disconformities)
  - Cross-bedded formations

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Select a Difficulty**: Choose Easy, Medium, or Hard from the main menu
2. **Examine the Image**: Study the geological cross-section image carefully
3. **Order the Layers**: Drag and drop the layer cards in the correct chronological order (oldest to youngest)
4. **Check Your Answer**: Click the "Check Answer" button to verify your sequence
5. **Track Your Progress**: View your statistics in the Trophy Case on the main menu

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: No build process required
