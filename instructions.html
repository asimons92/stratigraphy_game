        <h1>How to Play</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the logic of the Earth.

            While this game is based on Stratigraphy—the geological study of rock layers—you don't need a Ph.D. to play. You just need logic.
            
            Geologists are essentially time-detectives. They don't always need to know the exact date a rock formed (Absolute Age); they just need to figure out the sequence of events (Relative Age) to tell the story of the landscape.
            
            The goal of this game is simple: Sort the geological features from Oldest (formed first) to Youngest (formed last).

        <h2>The Rules (The Principles)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    <h3>The Principle of Superposition</h3>
                    The "Pancake Stack" Rule This is the easiest rule in the book. In an undisturbed pile of sedimentary rocks, the layer on the bottom was there first.
        
                    The Rule: If Layer A is below Layer B, Layer A is older.
        
                    Think of it like: A laundry basket. The clothes at the bottom were thrown in first.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Principle of Original Horizontality</h3>
                    The "Start Flat" Rule Sedimentary rocks are laid down flat due to gravity. If you see layers that are tilted, folded, or wavy, that movement happened after the rocks were made.

                    The Rule: Folding and tilting are younger than the rocks they affect.
        
                    Think of it like: A rug. You have to lay the rug down flat before you can wrinkle it up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Principle of Cross-Cutting Relationships</h3>
                    The "Cutter" Rule This is where the puzzles get tricky. Sometimes magma (intrusions) or cracks (faults) will cut through existing layers.

                    The Rule: The thing doing the cutting is younger than the thing getting cut.
        
                    Think of it like: Slicing a cake. You have to bake the cake (the rock layers) before you can slice it with a knife (the fault).

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Principle of Inclusions</h3>
                    The "Chocolate Chip Cookie" Rule Sometimes a rock layer will contain chunks (inclusions) of a different rock inside it.

                    The Rule: The chunks inside are older than the rock holding them.
        
                    Think of it like: A cookie. The chocolate chips had to exist before they could be baked into the cookie.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Unconformities</h3>
                    Sometimes we lose part of the rock record. This can be because no new sediment was depositied, or because some were eroded away.
                    We have to put this in the right order as well!
                </li>

            <h2>Hints & Strategy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Look for the "Cutter": If you see a fault line or a magma dike cutting through the whole image, that is often the youngest (or second youngest) event!</li>
                <li>Work Backwards: Sometimes it’s easier to find the very last thing that happened and work your way down to the bottom.</li>
                <li>Watch for Erosion: Squiggly lines usually mean erosion (an Unconformity). This means rock was removed before the next layer was put on top.</li>
            </ul>
